									<li class="li-title" style="width: 100%">Does MyCollab read or
										store my email contents?</li>
									<li class="li-text" style="width: 100%">No. MyCollab only uses
										the header section of an email, which contains the From, To,
										CC, Date and Message ID fields, to analyze your conversation
										trends -- much like reading the outside of an envelope without
										reading a letter's content. Additionally, we don't store any
										of your emails on our servers.</li>
