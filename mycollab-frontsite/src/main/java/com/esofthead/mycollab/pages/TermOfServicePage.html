			<h1>Terms of Services</h1>
			<div class="term-block">
				<h2>1. Acceptance of terms</h2>
				<p>By using Wrikes online and offline products and services
					(collectively, "the Service"), provided by Wrike, Inc.
					(collectively, "Wrike," "We" or "Us") you agree to be bound by the
					following Terms of Service ("TOS"). The TOS may be updated by us
					from time to time without notice. You can review the most current
					version of the TOS at any time at: http://www.wrike.com/terms.jsp.
				</p>
				<p>If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a
					company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
					authority to bind the entity to these terms and conditions, in
					which case the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to the entity. If
					you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these
					terms and conditions, you may not use the Service.</p>
				<p>You understand and agree that the Service may include
					advertisements. You also understand and agree that the Service may
					include certain communications from Wrike, such as service
					announcements and administrative messages, and that these
					communications are considered part of Wrike membership and that you
					will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Changes and features
					that augment or enhance the current Service shall be subject to the
					TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "as is"
					and that Wrike assumes no responsibility for the timeliness,
					deletion, mis-delivery of or failure to store any user content or
					settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service,
					which access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet Service
					Provider charges). You are responsible for those fees, including
					fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In
					addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment
					necessary to access the Service.</p>
				<p>You may not access the Service for purposes of monitoring its
					performance, availability, or functionality, or for any other
					benchmarking or competitive purposes, without Wrike's prior written
					consent. You may not access the Service if you are a direct
					competitor of Wrike, except with Wrike's prior written consent.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="term-block">
				<h2>2. Your account</h2>
				<p>In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent
					and warrant that (i) you are of legal age to form a binding
					contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under
					the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction,
					(ii) your use of the Service does not violate any applicable law or
					regulation, and (iii)you are human. Accounts registered by "bots"
					or other automated methods are not permitted. You also agree to:
					(a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about
					yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form
					("Registration Data"); and (b) maintain and promptly update the
					Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
					If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not
					current or incomplete, or Wrike has reasonable grounds to suspect
					that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or
					incomplete, Wrike has the right to suspend or terminate your
					account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service
					(or any portion thereof).</p>
				<p>Registration Data and certain other information about you is
					subject to our Privacy Policy which is incorporated by reference
					herein in its entirety. For more information, see our full privacy
					policy at http://www.wrike.com/privacy.html. You understand that
					through your use of the Service you consent to the collection and
					use (as set out in the Privacy Policy) of this information.</p>
				<p>You will receive a password and account designation upon
					completing the Service's registration process. You are responsible
					for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and
					are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your
					password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Wrike of
					any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other
					breach of security; and (b) ensure that you exit from your account
					at the end of each session. Wrike cannot and will not be liable for
					any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the
					TOS, including, without limitation, this Section 2.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="term-block">
				<h2>3. Billing</h2>
				<p>We will begin billing you for subscription fees corresponding
					to your subscription plan, plus any applicable tax, at the end of
					your free trial period, unless you cancel prior to the end of your
					free trial. To view the specific details of your subscription plan,
					check "Account &amp; Settings" or "My Profile" page available to you
					after logging into the Service. You will not receive a notice from
					us that your free trial has ended or that your paying subscription
					has begun.</p>
				<p>Your Service subscription will be automatically renewed at
					the end of your subscription period. We will bill the subscription
					fee plus any applicable tax to you. Your membership will
					automatically renew for successive subscriptions, without prior
					notice to you, unless and until you cancel your membership, or we
					terminate it. You must cancel your membership before it renews in
					order to avoid billing of the next period's subscription fees to
					your payment method.</p>
				<p>By using the Service, you are expressly agreeing that we are
					permitted to bill you a subscription fee, any applicable tax and
					any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the
					Service. Additional charges may include service level changes you
					request. The subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of
					your subscription and on each renewal thereafter, unless and until
					you cancel your membership. We will automatically bill you each
					billing period on the calendar day corresponding to the
					commencement of your membership. All fees and charges are
					nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially
					used periods, or where you have elected to downgrade service levels
					or otherwise remove any paid component or feature. If you elect to
					upgrade your service level or otherwise add any paid component or
					feature, we will pro-rate the amount due based on the number of
					days remaining in your billing cycle; provided, however, that any
					such proration shall be based on your service level or paid
					components or features in existence immediately prior to your
					election to upgrade or add paid components or features. We may
					change the fees and charges in effect or add new fees and charges
					from time to time. We will inform you of any increase or addition
					to existing fees and we may offer you a grace-period in which your
					fees will not increase for a certain period of time. If you do not
					accept the increase or addition to the existing fees, you may elect
					to terminate your account during the then current billing period
					and you shall not be liable for such fee increase after the
					applicable billing period; however, any later renewal of service
					will be subject to the increased fee structure. If your credit or
					debit card reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the
					Service constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing
					you, and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.</p>
				<p>If you change your service level (downgrade it), you may
					cause the loss of Content or features for your account. Wrike does
					not accept any liability for such loss. You may cancel your
					subscription to the Service at anytime, and cancellation will be
					effective immediately. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY
					PARTIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS OR ANY FEATURE OF COMPONENT THAT YOU
					HAVE PAID FOR BUT NOT USED.</p>
				<p>In connection with your purchase and/or use of the Service
					you may be subject to taxes, including, without limitation, sales
					and use taxes, by any authority which has jurisdiction to impose
					such taxes. You agree that the obligation and payment of any such
					taxes shall be your sole and absolute responsibility, and you agree
					to indemnify Wrike pursuant to Section 6(vi) to the extent that
					Wrike incurs any obligations or other liabilities in connection
					with such taxes.</p>

				<p>
					<em>Entire Agreement.</em> The TOS constitute the entire agreement
					between you and Wrike and govern your use of the Service,
					superseding any prior agreements between you and Wrike with respect
					to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and
					conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other
					Wrike services, affiliate services, third-party content or
					third-party software.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Choice of Law and Forum.</em> The TOS and the relationship
					between you and Wrike shall be governed by the laws of the State of
					California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You
					and Wrike agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
					jurisdiction of the courts located within the County of Los
					Angeles, State of California regardless of (i) your world-wide
					physical location, or (ii) the jurisdiction where you purchased or
					use the Service.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Notice and Future Changes.</em> Wrike may provide you with
					notices, including those regarding modifications to the TOS
					(including the Privacy Policy), by email or via the web-site. You
					agree to review the TOS (including the Privacy Policy) periodically
					so that you are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of
					the Service after any modifications indicates your acceptance of
					the modified TOS (and all other agreements, policies, rules and

					by Wrike, any new features, new services, enhancements or
					modifications to the Service implemented after your initial access
					to the Service shall be subject to these TOS.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Waiver and Severability of Terms.</em> The failure of Wrike to
					exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not
					constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of
					the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
					invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
					endeavor to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected in
					the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS shall remain in
					full force and effect.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability.</em> You
					agree that your Wrike account is non-transferable and any rights to
					your Wrike ID or contents within your account terminate upon your
					death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account
					may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted.

					statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
					arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be
					filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose
					or be forever barred.
