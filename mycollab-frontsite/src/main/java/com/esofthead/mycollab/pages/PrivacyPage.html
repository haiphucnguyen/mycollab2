							such as your e-mail address, name, company name, home and/or work
							address and telephone number. The amount and type of information
							that MyCollab gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
							For example, we ask visitors who sign up for projects at
							MyCollab.com to provide a username and email address. In the
							event that you contact us for customer support through the
							website, we may also request that you provide additional User
							Information relevant to the support requested by you. Users are
							under no obligation to provide such information, with the caveat
							that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
							activities. However, we cannot guarantee that we can provide
							customer support in the event that relevant information related
							to the use of our products or services is withheld. We may retain
							communications relating to customer support, and/or information
							drawn from such communications, for statistical and/or reference
							purposes.</p>
						<p>MyCollab also collects other information like Internet
							Protocol (IP) addresses. MyCollab does not use such information
							to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such
							information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses
							and discloses personally-identifying information, as described
							below.</p>
