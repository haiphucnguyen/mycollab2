MyCollab requires a Java Standard Edition Runtime
Environment (JRE) version 7 or later.

=============================
Running With JRE 7 Or Later
=============================

(1) Download and Install a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)

(1.1) Download a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE),
      release version 6 or later, from
      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

(1.2) Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the
      release.

      You may also use a full Java Development Kit (JDK) rather than just
      a JRE.


(2) Download and Install MyCollab

(2.1) Download a binary distribution of MyCollab from:

      http://www.mycollab.com

(2.2) Unpack the binary distribution so that it resides in its own
      directory (conventionally named "mycollab-[version]").

      For the purposes of the remainder of this document, the name
      "MYCOLLAB_HOME" is used to refer to the full pathname of that
      directory.


(3) Configure Environment Variables

MyCollab is a Java application and does not use environment variables. The
variables are used by the MyCollab startup scripts. The scripts use the variables
to prepare the command that starts MyCollab.

(3.1) Set MYCOLLAB_HOME (required)

The MYCOLLAB_HOME environment variable should be set to the location of the
root directory of the "binary" distribution of MyCollab.

An example was given in (2.2) above.

The MyCollab startup scripts have some logic to set this variable
automatically if it is absent, based on the location of the startup script
in *nix and on the current directory in Windows. That logic might not work
in all circumstances, so setting the variable explicitly is recommended.


(3.2) Set JRE_HOME or JAVA_HOME (required)

These variables are used to specify location of a Java Runtime
Environment or of a Java Development Kit that is used to start MyCollab.

The JRE_HOME variable is used to specify location of a JRE. The JAVA_HOME
variable is used to specify location of a JDK.

Using JAVA_HOME provides access to certain additional startup options that
are not allowed when JRE_HOME is used.

If both JRE_HOME and JAVA_HOME are specified, JRE_HOME is used.


(3.3) Other variables (optional)

Other environment variables exist, besides the four described above.
See the comments at the top of mycollab.bat or mycollab.sh scripts for
the list and a description of each of them.

One frequently used variable is MYCOLLAB_OPTS. It allows specification of
additional options for the java command that starts MyCollab.

See the Java documentation for the options that affect the Java Runtime
Environment.

See the "System Properties" page in the MyCollab Configuration Reference for
the system properties that are specific to MyCollab.

Another frequently used variable is MYCOLLAB_PID (on *nix only). It
specifies the location of the file where process id of the forked MyCollab
java process will be written. This setting is optional. It will enable the
following features:

 *  better protection against duplicate start attempts and
 *  allows forceful termination of MyCollab process when it does not react to
    the standard shutdown command.

(4) Start Up MyCollab

(4.1) MyCollab can be started by executing one of the following commands:

  On Windows:

      %MYCOLLAB_HOME%\bin\startup.bat

    or

      %MYCOLLAB_HOME%\bin\mycollab.bat start

  On *nix:

      $MYCOLLAB_HOME/bin/startup.sh

    or

      $MYCOLLAB_HOME/bin/mycollab.sh start
      
      
(4.2) If you start MyCollab at the first time, MyCollab will ask you to enter database 
information, email smtp information. Here are detail instruction of set up system 
variables.

(4.2.1)

(4.2.2) MyCollab requires MySQL schema to run, so first you must create a new schema instance 
in MySQL by typing `CREATE SCHEMA `mycollab` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 ;`

You need to give MyCollab your created database schema as well as username and password with sufficient
permission allows MyCollab can set up data

(4.2.3) MyCollab have many schedule jobs to send notification by email to you and members in your
 account, then it needs a SMTP account to do this job. This task is optional in case you want to 
 receive MyCollab notifications of your assignments and many more types of notification MyCollab 
 supported. 
 
 

(4.3) After startup, the default web applications included with MyCollab will be
      available by visiting:

      http://localhost:8080/

(4.4) Further information about configuring and running MyCollab can be found in
      the documentation included here, as well as on the MyCollab web site:

      http://www.mycollab.com/


(5) Shut Down MyCollab

(5.1) MyCollab can be shut down by executing one of the following commands:

  On Windows:

      %MYCOLLAB_HOME%\bin\shutdown.bat

    or

      %MYCOLLAB_HOME%\bin\mycollab.bat stop

  On *nix:

      $MYCOLLAB_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh

    or

      $MYCOLLAB_HOME/bin/mycollab.sh stop

================
Troubleshooting
================

There are only really 2 things likely to go wrong during the stand-alone
MyCollab install:

(1) The most common hiccup is when another web server (or any process for that
    matter) has laid claim to port 8080.  This is the default HTTP port that
    MyCollab attempts to bind to at startup.  To change this, open the file:

       $MYCOLLAB_HOME/conf/mycollab.properties

    and search for 'server.port'.  Change it to a port that isn't in use, and is
    greater than 1024, as ports less than or equal to 1024 require superuser
    access to bind under UNIX.

    Restart MyCollab and you're in business.  Be sure that you replace the "8080"
    in the URL you're using to access MyCollab.  For example, if you change the
    port to 1979, you would request the URL http://localhost:1979/ in your
    browser.

(2) The 'localhost' machine isn't found.  This could happen if you're behind a
    proxy.  If that's the case, make sure the proxy configuration for your
    browser knows that you shouldn't be going through the proxy to access the
    "localhost".

    In Firefox, this is under Tools/Preferences -> Advanced/Network ->
    Connection -> Settings..., and in Internet Explorer it is Tools ->
    Internet Options -> Connections -> LAN Settings.
