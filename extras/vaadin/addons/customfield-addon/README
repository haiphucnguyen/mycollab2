CustomField Add-on project
==========================

CustomField is an extension to CustomComponent from Vaadin core, but it is 
used to create composites that can work as Field implementation in Form.
Customization of both the visual presentation and the logic of the field is
possible.

Subclasses must at least implement the method {@link #getType()} and set the
composition root (typically in the constructor). In addition, other methods
can be overridden to customize the functionality.

Most custom fields can simply compose a user interface that calls the methods
setValue(Object)  and getValue(). It is also possible to override commit(),
setPropertyDataSource(Property) and other logic of the field.

The add-on also contains another related class called FieldWrapper. Similarly
it is a helper to composite a custom field of several Vaadin components. 
When using FieldWrapper most of the field logic is delegated to the "wrapped 
field". An example use case: Developer wants to bind a field to a property 
which actual value is a city. The value is defined by a drop down select 
which is then again filtered by continent and country drop downs (which 
are irrelevant from business logic's POV).

Refer to JavaDocs and examples/tests in the project page for more information.

Project page, SVN repository and issue tracker
==============================================

The project page with source code, issue tracker etc. can be found from 
following address:
http://code.google.com/p/customfield/

Use the project page for issue reports and contributing enhancements, 
vaadin.com/forum or Pro support is best source for help and general questions.

Building and development instructions
=====================================

The project is built with Maven. Tests contain some integration tests run 
with FirefoxDriver, so be sure to have Firefox installed. To build the 
project run following command:
mvn install

GUI demos/tests can be launch straight from IDE as CustomFieldApplication 
has main method that launches examples in embedded jetty.

Closely related helpers are in sister project customfield-utils.

Demos can be packages to war in sister project customfield-demo with 
"mvn package". Projects have no umbrella project so be sure to update 
versions as needed.
